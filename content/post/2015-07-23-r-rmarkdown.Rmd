# Abstract

# Introduction 

The Toronto open data portal contains many up to date public data sets concerning the cities on goings. One of which is the homeless shelter occupancy statistics, it is conveniently updated every day so we can examine the daily changes of those utilizing the city's public shelters. Given the availability of this data alongside the obvious confirmed COVID-19 cases data for the city I decided to examine the impact of the pandemic on Toronto's shelters. The results that were observed are quite interesting, and perhaps counter-intuitive. 

To run a comparative analysis of these two data sets the following variables were used: 

* Shelter data set: date, daily capacity, daily occupancy

* COVID-19 data set: date, daily new cases 

# Data Exploration
-covid graph
-daily capacity 
-occupancy + ratio 


# Conclusion 
-all 4 graphs

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
